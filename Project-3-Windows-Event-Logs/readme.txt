# Project 3: Analyzing Windows Event Logs for Security Incidents

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Windows Event Logs to detect and investigate security incidents.  
By completing this project, I practiced accessing event logs, filtering and searching for security-relevant events, analyzing event details, and using Log Parser 2.2 to extract meaningful insights.

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or later
- Basic understanding of Windows administration
- Familiarity with Event Viewer
- [Log Parser 2.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24659)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Accessing Windows Event Logs
Opened Event Viewer and explored System logs to understand types of events generated by Windows.

### Exercise 2: Understanding Security Event Logs
Examined Security logs and highlighted key Event IDs related to logons and account management (4624 and 4625).

### Exercise 3: Filtering and Searching Event Logs
Filtered Security logs to display only **failed logons (4625)**, demonstrating log filtering and search skills.

### Exercise 4: Analyzing Event Details
Reviewed details of failed logons, including:

- Account name  
- Logon type  
- Failure reason  
- Date and time  
- Source IP (if available)

This step demonstrates correlating events and investigating potential security incidents like a SOC analyst.

### Exercise 5: Using Log Parser 2.2
Ran SQL queries on the Security event log to identify the top sources of failed logons.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 EventID, COUNT(*) AS EventCount
FROM 'C:\Users\manzi\Documents\Security.evtx'
WHERE EventID=4625
GROUP BY EventID
ORDER BY EventCount DESC
